        "FIN7is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013 primarily targeting the U.S. retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors, often using point-of-sale malware. A portion ofFIN7was run out of a front company called Combi Security. Since 2020FIN7shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use ofREvilransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside.FIN7may be linked to theCarbanakGroup, but there appears to be several groups usingCarbanakmalware and are therefore tracked separately.[1][2][3][4][5]"
