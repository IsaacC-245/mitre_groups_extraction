The group has targeted victims primarily in South Korea, but also in Japan, Vietnam, Russia, Nepal, China, India, Romania, Kuwait, and other parts of the Middle East.APT37has also been linked to the following campaigns between 2016-2018: Operation Daybreak, Operation Erebus, Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are you Happy?, FreeMilk, North Korean Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018.[1][2][3]",
        "North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the nameLazarus Groupinstead of tracking clusters or subgroups."
