Malware used byLazarus Groupcorrelates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.[3]",
        "North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the nameLazarus Groupinstead of tracking clusters or subgroups, such asAndariel,APT37,APT38, andKimsuky."
